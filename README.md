This project is a web-based Property Visualization Tool that uses Leaflet.js to display and interact with real estate properties on an interactive map. It allows users to filter properties by value and size, search by owner or name, export data to CSV, and view detailed property and owner wealth insights â€” all in a sleek, user-friendly interface.
